# R Math

## Simple Math
In R, you can use operators to perform common mathematical operations on numbers.

### Addition

The `+` operator is used to add together two values:
```R
10 + 5

```

### And the - operator is used for subtraction:

```R
10 - 5

```

## Built-in Math Functions
R also has many built-in math functions that allows you to perform mathematical tasks on numbers.

For example, the min() and max() functions can be used to find the lowest or highest number in a set:

```R
max(5, 10, 15)
min(5, 10, 15)
```

### sqrt()
```R
sqrt(16)
```


### abs()
```R
abs(-4.7)
```


### ceiling() and floor()
```R
ceiling(1.4)
floor(1.4)
```
